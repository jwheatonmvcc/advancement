<h1>Local vs Global Scoping</h1>
<br>
<p>Variable Scoping controls where you can access variables</p>
<p>A <b>Global</b> variable can be accessed anywhere within a program</p>
<p>A <b>Local</b> variable can only be accessed within the function or file it is local to</p>
<br>
<p> You can have multiple variables with the same name as long as they operate within a different scope. The most local variable will be used if it exists before a global variable.
